# 🧠 When Math Meets Motion  
### 🎨 Visualizing the Hidden Harmony of Numbers  
**By Tanishq Sakhare**

## 📖 Overview

This project showcases two mesmerizing mathematical animations — **Rainbow Creature** and **Jellyfish** — created using **Python**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**. These animations aren't just art; they represent a computational expression of patterns, symmetry, and perception. Each frame is mathematically driven, offering insight into how numbers can generate complex and lifelike visuals.

Inspired by visual perception and the “binding problem” in neuroscience, these visualizations show how your brain unifies thousands of moving points into one meaningful form — without a central coordinator.
